        <strong>Tank Shooter:</strong>ChatGPT said:

The Tank Shooter project is a 2D action game developed using Unity and C#, where the player controls a tank to aim, shoot, and destroy enemy targets. The game includes smooth player movement, shooting mechanics, enemy AI, collision detection, and score tracking. It also features health management and a simple user interface that displays the player’s score and remaining health. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of game physics, object interactions, and scripting in Unity, while improving my logical thinking and problem-solving skills in game development.
